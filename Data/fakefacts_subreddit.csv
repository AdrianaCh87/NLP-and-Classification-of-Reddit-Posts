"Songwriter David Paich of Toto was inspired to write ""Africa"" after he had received fan mail from a poor African boy who liked the group's music.

In a 1992 interview, previous member David Hungate recalled a conversation with Paich over the letter:

""I remember that night, Dave was absolutely ecstatic. I asked him, 'what's the big deal over one single fan?' to which he replied, 'I'm this boy's god-damn hero just because I write some songs that I like the sound of. He wrote me a letter, maybe not even expecting anyone to read it, because he saw me as a guiding hope in his world!'""

Paich was determined to meet this boy, a 10-year old Ethiopian from the now-prospering village of Metemma who simply referred to himself as ""Haile"". Finding some downtime in 1985, Paich convinced the whole band to fly down to Ethiopia in order to find Haile.

After a couple weeks of searching (and some luck), Paich was finally able to find Haile's village and immediate family. When Paich asked Haile, who was 14 by this point, if he remembered the band, Haile replied with ""how could anyone forget?""

The band ended up playing a live performance of Africa, along with several other hits that Haile had mentioned in his first letter. Publicizing the event, Paich and the band successfully raised over $250,000 in fundraising for Metemma and surrounding communities for investments into drought-resisting techniques and technology. However, the fundraiser was largely overshadowed by the much larger ""Live Aid"" event, also concerning the famine in Ethiopia.",fakefacts

This can be difficult to prove. There has to be an impartial third party witness that is willing to testify that there is no possible or conceivable way that you read the contract.

This is actually why all contracts are legally required to have the words ""I have read and agree with..."" on the document right before you sign. By proving you didn't read it, you are also proving you didn't agree to it.

You can get out of all kinds of contracts using this method. It can be used to get out of repaying your student loans.

The research mission began in 1970 when James P. Sullivan had gone on a penguin research expedition to find a link between krill and albatross habitat loss. During his research he’d witnessed a penguin feasting on what looked like a human foot. Shocked by the discovery he watched as the penguin dismissed the bone. Sullivan quickly scooped the bone, careful not to infringe on the penguins way of life, before running DNA tests and conjuring up theories. After weeks of patience and research the results came back. The DNA on the bone was in fact human, and belonged to a woman from 4,200 years ago. Sullivan also revealed the woman was around 69 years old and named her Ultima, after one of the original names for Antarctica. After forty more years of research the archaeologists, geologists, and paleontologists put their heads together and discovered that there was an ancient tribe of civilisation, many at that. They lived during the Mesozoic era, a time in which geological shifts were occuring all across the Earth. Across Antarctica it was a tropical paradise, resembling the Amazon rainforest for reference. Islands rose out of the Arctic Ocean and revealed coniferous trees that held shade for the civilisations under it. All these islands sprouting happened during the Jurassic age meaning that, the people of Antarctica were one of the only human civilisations to live among dinosaurs. And peacefully at that. Ancient drawings and carvings depict the herbivore dinosaur Glacialisaurus helping the people build what is claimed to be a house or living area of some sort.

Anyways. We need to go over a few things.

1. Please put effort into your post. Generally, I don't like fake facts just in the title. Put some more effort by putting more details of it in the text part. 

2. Try to stay away from facts talking down on religions. Basically, try not to offend people of that religion. 

3. Saying something outrageous that we would generally know isn't a fact. Example: The speed limit everywhere is actually 5mph. We know it's not 5mph. Say something like this: Before speed limits were a thing, Car manufacturers created speed limits by limiting the speed of the car internally. 

4. Don't make up fake subreddit rules up like some have been doing.

5. Don't make things that could harm people. For example: ""Drinking bleach helps digest food faster.""
You will get banned if I see something like this. No exceptions

6. Report facts breaking these rules

Given the level of literacy at the time, it was impractical to expect everyone to be able to read the text written on currency. A simple symbol like the dollar sign, with two strokes for US and one for Canadian was simple enough a concept that even the illiterate could see the difference.

There was a point in US and Canadian history where the borders were ill-defined and paper bills were printed on a state-by-state (or territory-by-territory or province-by-province) basis and varied wildly in design and size. The double- and single-stroke dollar sign was an attempt to create an easily identifiable difference between US and Canadian currency. Some Canadian banks issued currency with a C with a single stroke (￠) through it instead, in an attempt to make the difference between the two countries' currency more stark. This only added to the confusion.

Coins on the other hand were somewhat easier to deal with: State officials simply smelted and re-cast the coins as they filtered through banks. It didn't matter where they came from.

Eventually, however, the standardization of currency in both countries was centralized and uniform US and Canadian currency was defined.",fakefacts

Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I & II was originally going to be the mobile version of Sonic Generations.,30,c25a6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/FakeFacts/comments/c25a6w/sonic_the_hedgehog_4_episode_i_ii_was_originally/,0,1560908471.0,"As development of Sonic Generations began in 2009, SEGA had planned a mobile version of Sonic Generations for iPhone and Android users who couldn't buy the console versions or the console itself. It was planned to have 8 zones, these are speculated to be: Green Hill Zone, Metropolis Zone, Hydrocity Zone, Windy Valley and the rest are unknown.

&#x200B;

It would feature gameplay similar to the DS version apart from Modern Sonic had no boost and had the spin-dash, these features stuck until Episode I was released. As development continued, SEGA had realised that the game was going to use up too much storage on the phone and the phone would lag, testing also said that the game crashed sometimes during certain levels (These levels are unknown.)

&#x200B;

SEGA tried to save the project by splitting it into two parts, they would publish the other part on a later date. The project was then rebranded as Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I because employees would say the game would get bad reception due to physics changes and the removal of the boost. Some zones were scrapped and never saw the light of day and Green Hill and Metropolis were renamed Splash Hill and Mad Gear and fit into the final game. 1 classic levels that was planned for console was inserted as well, it was Labyrinth Zone (renamed as Lost Labyrinth.) Some gimmicks seen in game are based on tilting a screen like the mine carts in Lost Labyrinth, this is evidence that this was originally a mobile game. The copying of zones, the bosses, moves like the spin-dash and the release date of Episode I being close to Sonic's 20th Anniversary all point to an anniversary game such as Sonic Generations.

&#x200B;

Finally, the game was rushed out on 7th October 2010, more than a year before Sonic Generations. It was released for Android, Wii, iOS, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, Windows Phone and Ouya. Episode I got average reviews around 6/10 but on the other hand, Generations had a whopping score of around 9/10 but SEGA remembered the second part that was split up during development, they immediately got to work with it and Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II was released on 15th May 2012 and got review scores of up to 9/10.

In 2003, Prince Hans-Adam II's proposed revisions to the constitution were approved, much media attention was paid to the extensive executive rights he granted himself which, among other power-grabs, included the ability to dissolve government and veto any legislation passed by the now greatly diminished parliament. 

Equally covered, was a clause concerning the protocol to be taken in case of rockfall, mudslide, avalanche or other mountain related disasters (""marauding goats"") wiping out the majority of the country and, with it, the Liechtensteiners themselves.

Top on Hans' mind was his succession to the throne, his penchant for fervent patriotism has been noted on many occasions and, with that, the customs of this small constitutional monarchy are objects and ideals he holds dear. The ability for an individual to immediately take the throne for constitutional purposes, especially in light of his amendments was, in his eyes, key. 

Therefore, the clause promulgated that if a family were to bare five children, the fifth, if a boy, would be put in line for the throne - in theory creating an infinite succession of heirs. The primary aims being to secure a fluid transition for Liechtenstein in case of catastrophe taking out a large portion of the population, including the royal family, whilst simultaneously increasing the number of survivors. 

The clause has gone down well with the largely Roman Catholic nation, resulting in an ever-increasing spike in birthrate since its enactment.

Originally, ""eye spy"" was said as a crude attempt at: ""the eye is spying"". Following this, the participant would hum or grunt whilst frantically spinning in circles to demonstrate all of the possible areas they could have been looking. The other participants would then be allowed to guess - as we do today. 

It took several hundred years before the English language could produce the now immortal ""with my little eye, something beginning with"", and by this time the pronoun ""I"" had replaced ""eye"".

A bylaw of the City of London states that it's mandatory for cat owners to have a bucket of water handy in their homes at all times.,20,71xlfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FakeFacts/comments/71xlfg/a_bylaw_of_the_city_of_london_states_that_its/,0,1506192202.0,"The law was introduced after a major fire in 1732, when one of the city's old, medieval neighbourhoods went up in flames. The fire cost the lives of dozens of people and caused (normalised to current currency values) millions of Pounds of damage. 

After an official investigation, it was discovered that the fire started because of a fallen candle in a mapmakers's house. According to the report, the cartographer was working late one night, finishing one of his maps by candlelight, when the family cat jumped onto his desk and knocked over the candle. The brittle paper provided plenty fuel for the flames, and by the time the mapmaker and his family had fetched pails of sand and water, the fire had already rapidly spread through the house. The neighbourhood's wooden structures, jammed together alongside narrow streets, stood little chance against the ensuing inferno. 

As the mapmaker lived to give a full account of the fire's origins (though the fate of the cat is unknown), the City Council decided to make it mandatory for every cat-owner to have water on hand to stop a future disaster from happening in the same way. Over the years, the law stopped being enforced, and it is now just yet another curiosity in the City of London's extensive legal framework. ",fakefacts

Number theorist Johannes Berenstain of Salzburg, Austria was the first to find out differently. While working through an unrelated proof in 1758, he realized that one of its corollaries could shed new light on the primality of 2-digit numbers. He put aside the proof (and in fact, never returned to it), and the next day was able to prove that 91 was a multiple of 7.

Aware that 91 was not an integral power of 7, Berenstein realized that yet another factor remained to be found; he kept the interim result to himself. In late 1759 he had found the other factor: 13.

His presentation to the Conference WeissMathematiker in Vienna was not the stodgy affair we all imagine. Several members in the audience stood up in applause; but arguments among others led to fistfights that spilled out into rioting in the streets. A church was set on fire and dozens of people were injured, but there were no fatalities.

Nowadays, many are not aware that the second verse of the children's song ""Jetzt auf Gläben micht Schön"" is a metaphorical allusion to Berenstain's proof.

Study of the (non-)primality of 2-digit numbers continues. Physicist Vassily Viswanath in the National University of Singapore expects to publish a a paper on the number 59 within the year. Even if no additional factors are found, his findings will still have implications for the rapidly-changing world of higher mathematics.",fakefacts

The average abacus used to be roughly the height of a small barn .,13,6vtqm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FakeFacts/comments/6vtqm4/the_average_abacus_used_to_be_roughly_the_height/,4,1503636385.0,"Until the beginning of the 18th century, abacuses, or abaci, throughout Western Europe and the United States were produced as large, cumbersome constructions. Usually as large as a small barn, though some in excess of 20 feet existed, they could only be operated by, in the words of one of the masters of the so called ""Bead Boys"", ""a squadron of five to eight, enthusiastic, barrel-chested youths"".

With the rise of the timber industry, large firms suppressed the technology, information and means to produce more reasonably sized, hand operable abaci. As time continued, those who remembered these more functional tools passed and the larger formats requiring obscene amounts of wood (much the intention of the slowly forming Wooden Abaci Cartel) became the norm.

 So much so, their sites became communal spots for many people groups and communities. A central point of meeting to share the week's tidings, discuss upcoming events and, of course, utilise the abacus' calculating capabilities. 

At the time, as is the contemporary use of calculators, certain mathematical equations were unobtainable to the average citizen without a device to abet their numerical qualm. Counting sessions on the giant abaci, depending on the number of those in need of algebraic relief, could go well into the late evening. Bands of musicians would serenade the waiting crowds, offering a distraction from the monotony of the abacus, whilst adding a rhythmic accompaniment to the ""Bead Boys'"" efforts.

Giant abaci eventually lost their relevance with a general decline in interest in mathematics throughout the Western world; starting at the beginning of the 18th century and not finishing until the creation of the first electric calculators in the 1960s. The subsequent media circus generated by these breakthroughs brought numbers back into the public's purview. By 1972, the HP-35 pocket calculator was on the market, literally saving mathematics from becoming obsolete.

Doc Antle and Don Lewis were rivals, but the show ""Tiger King"" didn't justify the extent of their rivalry. Allegedly, his plan was to have both Don and Carole disappear. Doc was under the impression that both Don and Carole would be going to Costa Rica, but on the morning of their trip, only Don showed up. Doc had ordered someone else to ""take care of"" Don and Carole, and when only Don showed up, they still carried out Doc's order to make Don disappear. The evidence is not concrete enough to guarantee a conviction. There are records of Doc traveling to Tampa in the months leading up to Don's disappearance, and right before and again right after, Doc transferred $25,000 around through several different bank accounts before making a cash withdraw. After combing through decades of bank records, the only time Doc transferred money through different accounts like that was the day before Don's disappearance, and then again 4 days after Don's disappearance. If convicted, this would clear Carole Baskin of any involvement in her husband's disappearance.


Doc was a major influence and mentor to Joe Exotic. Doc cultivated a hatred for Carole in Joe. Doc was also the one they introduced Joe to Jeff Lowe, and subsequently Allen Glover. Allen Glover alluded on the show that he is from South Carolina, and had previously worked for Doc Antle. Doc hired Jeff to get close to Joe, told Jeff to hire Allen, and then later suggest to Joe that Joe should pay Allen to kill Carole. If the plan was successful, Carole would no longer be a threat. If the plan failed, there were so many degrees of separation that NOBODY would ever suspect Doc was involved. Many people on the show mentioned several times that Jeff didn't have any money, but he still managed to live a luxurious life. Doc gave money to Jeff that was meant to go to the GW Zoo in order for Joe to entrust Jeff, but Jeff often spent that money on himself.


This investigation started with the raid on Doc Antle's zoo in late 2019. That raid led to search warrants for other files, documents, and hard drives. We believe that the items recovered contain sufficient evidence to convict Doc Antle on murder conspiracy charges, which would also take down Jeff Lowe and Allen Glover. This evidence should also clear Joe Exotic of any involvement in the murder-for-hire plot.",fakefacts

In fact, a man with a higher pitched voice after those ages was occasionally praised by the aristocracy and nobility, and Alexander the Great was even worshipped because he had an unknowingly naturally higher-pitched voice. The reason the voice being higher pitched in a man was praised was because it was likely considered a rite of passage into heaven or the afterlife by many empires; to live through adolescence and not have a man's voice heavily weathered into deepening could have been thought as being a musical preference for the gods that were prominently worshipped then.",fakefacts

At the meantime, the war just dragged on further, without any end in sight.

As the British government saw an increasing demand for financial support from the army, while trading income dwindled, they resorted to raising war taxes among its population. 

While trade with Europe was practically impossible, much of the rest of the world was still open to British ships, and while continental traders were out of a job, the harbours still rattled with the sound of carts, transporting goods from the countryside to the ships heading to India and beyond.

The government took notice of the apparently flourishing business of these traders, and devised a way to indirectly tax them, disproportionately to their workless colleagues, without overtly antagonising them. The Wheel Tax of 1812 was thereby seen as an excellent compromise. The idea was that people who had enough funds to transport large amounts of goods, also needed carts with more wheel to carry their burden. After all, the higher the weight of the shipment, the more axes you need to spread that weight across to prevent one from snapping. Therefore, a tax was levied proportionally to the amount of wheels someone had beneath their vehicle.

The unforeseen problem was that many carts were used to transport people, not goods. People, who now also had to pay a tax over their mode of transport. When the wheel taxes became an increasing burden on the British population, an enterprising inventor called Edward Rutherford, invented a vehicle utilising only two wheels. The advantages for non-traders were obvious: the small vehicle could achieve higher speeds than the traditional carts, and the owner had to pay a much lower wheel tax than before.

Anyways. We need to go over a few things.

1. Please put effort into your post. Generally, I don't like fake facts just in the title. Put some more effort by putting more details of it in the text part. 

2. Try to stay away from facts talking down on religions. Basically, try not to offend people of that religion. 

3. Saying something outrageous that we would generally know isn't a fact. Example: The speed limit everywhere is actually 5mph. We know it's not 5mph. Say something like this: Before speed limits were a thing, Car manufacturers created speed limits by limiting the speed of the car internally. 

4. Don't make up fake subreddit rules up like some have been doing.

5. Don't make things that could harm people. For example: ""Drinking bleach helps digest food faster.""
You will get banned if I see something like this. No exceptions

6. Report facts breaking these rules

Becoming increasingly paranoid, they realized it was their foolish antics that has cursed both of them to not being able to relieve themselves. Lighting a match, one of the scientists decides it'd be best to conjure the spirit of both their inspirations - Marie Curie - to see which one of them should have to sacrifice themselves into fixing the contaminated stall with the other using the clean one.

As a gassy and gastly image begins to appear in the mirror, the woman on the left of the mirror all of a sudden cannot hold it in any longer. Forgetting to not run with a knife in hand, she slips trying to feel her way to the wrong stall and totally dies somehow. Marie Curie's spirit shakes her head in dismay and tells the remaining scientist, ""If you really want me to fix the nuclear leak nearby, you're gonna have to make me an undying presence to those who are brave enough to summon me, and for every teenage life I inevitably take at slumber parties, I will use their life force to stop the degradation of the radioactive atoms spilling out of Chernobyl.

His solution was to install bristles along the escalator’s length so riders could scrub the sand from their shoes. Early versions had a trough beneath the bristles to catch the sand and carry it away from the mechanisms. Later versions of the escalator sealed the motor and gears inside a housing, eliminating the problem of sand, but the bristles proved so popular that they remained part of the design, though the trough was seen as obsolete and removed.

Often when witch hunts occurred, since it's difficult to organise a whole town into a single military force overnight, local groups would commonly hunt together, thus people would get to know their neighbours during these events.
